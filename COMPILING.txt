# Compiling instructions


## Dependencies
In der Regel sind die 90er vorbei requires jQuery to run correctly, which is not provided with this source. Currently we include jQuery 1.6.1 (minified) which you can download here: http://code.jquery.com/jquery-1.6.1.min.js or here: http://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.6.1/jquery.min.js

Just put it in your sources directory and **double-check that the filename is correct** when you compile the extension in Safari Extension Builder (e.g. update Info.plist) or Chrome.

Please note that this project is BSD-licensed and include LICENSE.txt in your bundle / provide the license with your download.


## Compiling with Safari Extension Builder

Note: In order to build Safari extensions, you have to be an Apple Registered Developer and request a certificate (http://developer.apple.com/certificates/) to sign any extension you create.

Source files you'll need:
* Info.plist
* regel.css
* regelscript.js
* jquery-1.6.1-min.js

After checking out the repository fire up Safari and open the extension builder (Developer -> Extension Builder; if can't see 'Developer' in your menu bar, open Safari’s preferences by selecting ‘Safari, Preferences’ from the menu, click the 'Advanced' tab and place a check mark next to 'Show Develop menu in menu bar.'). Click the plus sign in the lower left corner, select 'Add extension' and navigate to the folder you just checked out the repository to. Click ok and you're done.

Now visit http://derstandard.at and enjoy a clutter-free user experience!

If you need more help, visit http://developer.apple.com/library/safari/#documentation/Tools/Conceptual/SafariExtensionGuide/UsingExtensionBuilder/UsingExtensionBuilder.html to familiarize yourself with the basics.


## Compiling with Chrome

Source files you'll need:
* manifest.json
* regel.css
* regelscript.js
* jquery-1.6.1-min.js

After checking out the repository fire up your Chrome browser and open the extension tab (Window -> Extensions or simply chrome://extensions). On the right hand side press the little plus sign next to „Developer mode“. Next click “Load unpacked extensions...“ and navigate to the folder you just checked out the repository to. Click ok and you're done, the extension is already activated for you.

PS: It's working on dastandard.at and diestandard.at too! Yeah!
