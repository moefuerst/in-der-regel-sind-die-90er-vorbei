# Compiling instructions


## Dependencies
In der Regel sind die 90er vorbei requires jQuery to run correctly, which is not provided with this source. Currently we include jQuery 1.6.1 (minified) which you can download here: http://code.jquery.com/jquery-1.6.1.min.js or here: http://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.6.1/jquery.min.js

Just put it in your sources directory and **double-check that the filename is correct** when you compile the extension in Safari Extension Builder (e.g. update Info.plist) or Chrome.

Please note that this project is BSD-licensed and include LICENSE.txt in your bundle / provide the license with your download.
