# In der Regel sind die 90er vorbei

In der Regel sind die 90er vorbei is a BSD-licensed open-source browser-extension to unclutter, de-90-tize and improve your derStandard.at experience. [(To make it look like this)](http://i.imgur.com/FirhnBd.png?1)

## Features
* **90s b gone** – removes the background-colors to improve readability, restores (some) commonly accepted interface conventions of modern web-development

* **remove clutter** – stuff that no one cares about doesn't need to be displayed 

* **asozial-mode™** – no “share on <insert social networking site>”, no “tell your friends by clicking that unnecessary button”, no links to the facebook page

* **SHUT UP** – who needs comments, right? completely silences the “community” 

(and there's more to come, check out the [[Roadmap|Roadmap]] )
